      <p>
        I am 30 years old. I am a versatile person. My hobbies are cinema,
        handicrafts, video games, programming. I believe that a person needs to
        constantly be in development, learning new things, improving acquired
        skills. I have no commercial development experience, but I am able to
        maintain interest for a long time, I can compensate for the gaps in
        education with diligence and perseverance.
